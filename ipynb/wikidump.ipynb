      "Machine learning and [[data mining]] often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on ''known'' properties learned from the training data, [[data mining]] focuses on the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of (previously) ''unknown'' properties in the data (this is the analysis step of [[knowledge discovery]] in databases). [[Data mining]] uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"[[unsupervised learning]]\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [[ECML PKDD]] being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to ''reproduce known'' knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously ''unknown'' knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n",

Its most common form is [[linear regression]], where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [[ordinary least squares]]. The latter is often extended by [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [[ridge regression]]. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [[polynomial regression]] (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Christopher|title=Tutorial: Polynomial Regression in Excel|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|access-date=22 January 2017|archive-date=2 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602200850/https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|url-status=live}}</ref>), [[logistic regression]] (often used in [[statistical classification]]) or even [[kernel regression]], which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [[kernel trick]] to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\n",

For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [[Bayesian inference|inference]] and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like [[speech recognition|speech signals]] or [[peptide sequence|protein sequences]], are called [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s.

      "The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as [[probability]], [[Possibility theory|possibility]] and  [[Imprecise probability|imprecise probability theories]]. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g.,  Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a [[Probability mass function|pmf]]-based Bayesian approach{{clarify|date=January 2024}} would combine probabilities. However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and [[uncertainty quantification]]. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various [[ensemble methods]] to better handle the learner's [[decision boundary]], low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /> However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.\n",

      "=== Training models ===\n",
      "Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a [[corpus of text]], a collection of images, [[sensor]] data, and data collected from individual users of a service. [[Overfitting]] is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. [[Algorithmic bias]] is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training.

      "Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the [[Test set|holdout]] method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-[[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kohavi|first1=Ron|title=A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection|journal=International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence|date=1995|url=https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/accEst.pdf|access-date=2023-03-26|archive-date=2018-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712102706/http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/cs573/Papers/Kohavi-IJCAI-95.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\n",
